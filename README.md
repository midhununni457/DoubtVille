# DoubtVille

## Project Overview
DoubtVille is a website for students where they can ask doubts and get them answered. They can also upload pictures along with their doubts to help others better understand the problem.
The posts(doubts) are categorized based on the class whose syllabus relates to the specific doubt. Each class is also subdivided into subjects to further categorize the doubts.

## Note
This is an incomplete project of mine. This was my first web dev project, but unfortunately I wasn't able to complete it at the time, but I hope to complete it and make this a working application one day.
