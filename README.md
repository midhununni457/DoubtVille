# DoubtVille

## Introduction
This is a web application I was building about an year ago. Unfortunately I wasn't able to complete it after 12th classes began, but I hope to complete it and make this a working application one day.

## Project Overview
DoubtVille is a website for students where they can ask doubts and get them answered. They can also upload pictures along with their doubts to help others better understand the problem.
The posts(doubts) are categorized based on the class whose syllabus relates to the specific doubt. Each class is also subdivided into subjects to further categorize the doubts.
